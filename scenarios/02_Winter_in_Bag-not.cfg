			story = _"It's hard to assess how long Marbus' clan occupied the Bag'not Fortress. The elders sometimes weaved stories about mighty Elebor, a human fortress turned to ruin by a sorcerer. Not much time have passed until the wizard kicked the bucket himself. A dozen years or so after that happened, elves invaded northern lands. That is when the orcs set out to erect minor fortresses along the most important cities. Bag'not was one of these, it's aim was to defend Gelu'Aben. the motherland of swords"
		[/part]
		[part]
			story = _"Gelu'Aben was a city dealing mainly with metals. Smelters, armouries, traders selling metal articles made by orcs, elves, dwarves and humans. Being placed far in the north, it was almost unreachable for elvish armies. Road to the city led through Tut'anor pass. Even the elves heard about it. It was infamous, having thin passes and numerous traps. Raiders abandoned plans of an assault on the city. Obvoiusly, there waas another path, going through dwarven caverns. By that time, dwarves hadn't joined the elvish army yet. When they did that, had long been forgotten."
		[/part]
		[part]
			story =_"A dozen years after the raid, when orcs started coming to the south again, Gelu'Aben's chieftain, Sovereign Gewold commanded to settle Bag'not again. He sent there the least accepted creatures in the city, goblins. Together with them, he also sent to the south a small orcish division. It consisted mainly of individuals who had any goblin in his family."
		[/part]
		[part]
			story=_"Path through the Tut'anor pass was fearsome and perilous. Immense snakes and spiders and feeling of being watched. Evil in this place was indeed sensate. Yet, Marbus managed to pass it with his legions almost without any casualties. Settling Gelu'aben was a piece of cake in comparison to that. Goblins represented three quarters of Marbus's clan's population and were treated equally with orcs. Even Marbus had a goblin cousin, Kochan, who took charge of wolf raiders. Life here was good, or at least not worse than in Gelu'Aben. Until now..."
		[/part]
		[part]
			story=_"Winter turned out to be even worse than expected. What is more, everything was surrounded by outre, worrying fog. Fear aroused in orcish hearts and was creeping into their dreams. Not so long after that, there appeared a rumour that the forests are not safe anymore. Numbers of those who didn't come back, perished for ever. Thus, the dwellers started to get wood from the purlieus of the villages. Soon after they had run out of it, the wooden bridge got disassembled. One of these days, the fear showed it's face at last."
