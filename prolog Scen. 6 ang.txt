Gewold:
We made it, Marbus! We're alive! And it seems like it's thanks to you... Though in my personal opinion, it's rather that I saved you.

Marbus:
Hahaha... I'm glad that it's over now... But to the point... It's time we gathered the Horde. Undead are going after us from the south... And from what you said, the are also coming from the north... Let's send ravens to the chieftains...

Gewold:
The ravens fled some time ago, to ask for rescue. From what I know, only few minors clans remain.

Kochan:
These are very worrying news, cousin. It seems like we can't bargain for more warriors, nor for a shelter.

Marbus:
For now, we have other worries. We must call the elder and hold a meeting.

Gewold:
Calm down, warrior! First let's take care of the bodies, patch up the wounded. The last people from Northern Alliance are scattering in fright. Let's loot their camp and hold a feast!

Marbus:
For many days we hadn't had rest... So be it! Ragh for En Traht! We won the battle!

The forces of dwarves and Northern Alliance have been vanquished, and Marbus' clan joined forces with residents of Gelu'Aben. Soon after that, they managed to dress their wounds, say goodbye to the dead and feed the hungry. The orcish elders decided to bring out the last supplies out of the granaries and a great feast was hold, with Marbus as a honoured guest. Everybody's happiness lasted the whole day. One day, in which they managed to forget about the winter, the hordes of undead and about the Northern Alliance running rampant.
One day after the feast, there was a meeting arranged, which's reason was to solve all problems, which afflicted the orcish clans. Everybody with who the elders were still in touch with, came along. A proud, once great nation of orcs wasn't even able to fill half of the city. On the streets, women, oldsters and attenuated children were wandering around. Only here and there you could find a man with weapon, or a goblin, whittling arrows for another battle. Gelu'Aben was becoming a grave.
On the meeting, twelve people came along: clans' representatives and the elders. Everybody tried to enforce his standpoint, and all of them based on one clear concept: to stay in the fortress and wait out. Only Marbus though, that this way the won't survive. After slamming his hand on the table and putting orcs in order, he managed to convince them, that all what awaits them here is death. Gewold was the first person to object Marbus: escape isn't an option, because where are they supposed to go?


I tutaj odezwali siê starsi: istnia³a opuszczona twierdza na wschodzie, za górami. Mieœci³a siê ona na owianych tajemnic¹ Polach Kalindorskich. Mia³y siê tam znajdowaæ staro¿ytne orkowe pisma, które traktowa³y o tym, jak przetrwaæ tak¹ apokalipsê. Ca³oœæ tego planu wydawa³a siê opieraniem swoich dzia³añ na bajkach i mitach, jednak w obecnej sytuacji nikt nie móg³ wymyœliæ lepszego rozwi¹zania. Nikt te¿ nie móg³ wpaœæ na to, jak przedrzeæ siê przez góry.
Marbus, który ju¿ powzi¹³ decyzjê o dostaniu siê na Pola Kalindorskie, zaproponowa³, by zaprowadziæ orków krasnoludzkimi tunelami. Choæ Gelu'Aben znajdowa³o siê tylko kawa³ek drogi od nich, ¿adne z orków od lat nie przekracza³ progu wykutych przez krasnoludy jaskiñ. Wojownicza niegdyœ rasa zaczê³a baæ siê potêgi, jak¹ sta³¹ siê Knalga.
Podjêto g³osowanie, które mia³o zadecydowaæ o przysz³oœci wszystkich klanów. Siedem z dwunastu osób zgodzi³o siê na to, by ruszyæ tunelami. Ta sama siódemka podjê³a te¿ decyzjê o tym, by Marbus zosta³ nowym Wielkim Suwerenem. Gewold siedzia³ w ciszy: by³ przeciwny obu tym decyzjom.
Nastêpnego ranka Wielka, Zjednoczona Horda pochwyci³a pochodnie i poczê³a podpalaæ miasto. Po zaledwie godzinie, wspania³e niegdyœ Gelu'Aben zamieni³o siê w ruinê. Nie by³o ju¿ powrotu: tylko elfowie w lasach i ¿o³nierze Sojuszu ogl¹dali, jak czarny dym unosi³ siê nad miastem. Mia³ siê unosiæ jeszcze d³ugo, zaczadzaj¹c tych, którzy spróbowali w tym czasie zbli¿yæ siê do miasta. Marbus zaœ powzi¹³ sztandar Wielkiego Suwerena i pierwszy wst¹pi³ pod ziemiê, prowadz¹c swoich braci w mroki krasnoludzkich tuneli.
